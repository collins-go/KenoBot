Accurate,accurate,Passive,,Yes,Accurate weapons are easier to aim or wield. whether through design or technology. For each level of this trait. the attacker adds (${boostEmoji}) to his attack dice pools while using this weapon.,Edge of the Empire - Core Rulebook P:155. 
Auto-Fire,auto-fire,Active,2,No,Attacking with a weapon on Auto-fire is generally less accurate. the attacker must increase the difficulty of the attack check by (${difficultyEmoji}). The user may choose to not use the Auto-fire quality on a weapon; in this case. he cannot trigger the quality. but also does not suffer the aforementioned penalty. If the attack hits. the attacker can trigger Auto-fire by spending (${advantageEmoji}${advantageEmoji}). Auto-fire can be triggered multiple times. Each time Auto-fire is triggered. it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an additional hit from that weapon. and each hit deals base damage plus the number of uncanceled (${successEmoji}) on the check. These additional hits can be allocated to the target. or to other targets within range of the weapon. If the attacker wishes to hit multiple targets. he must decide to do so before making the check. Furthermore. if he to hit multiple targets. his initial target must always be the target with the highest difficulty and highest defense (if this is two separate targets. the GM chooses which target is the initial target). The initial hit must always be against the initial target. Subsequent hits generated can be allocated to any of the other designated targets. Auto-fire weapons can also activate one Critical Injury for each hit generated on the attack. per the normal cost; the Critical must target the target of the specific hit.,Edge of the Empire - Core Rulebook P:155.

In a relatively small and enclosed area. the Game Master might decide that everyone in the room suffers damage. If the Blast quality doesn’t activate. the ordnance still detonates. but bad luck or poor aim on the part of the firer (or quick reactions on the part of the victims) means the explosion may not catch anyone else in its radius. However. the user may also trigger Blast if the attack misses by spending (${advantageEmoji}${advantageEmoji}${advantageEmoji}). In this case. the original target and every target engaged with the original target suffers damage equal to the Blast rating of the weapon.,Edge of the Empire - Core Rulebook P:155.

This is an Average (${difficultyEmoji}${difficultyEmoji}) Coordination check on hard surfaces such as a hallway inside of a spaceship. or an Easy (${difficultyEmoji}) Coordination check on grass or soft ground.
